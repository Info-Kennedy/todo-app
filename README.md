# Todo App

A cross-platform Todo application built with Flutter, supporting offline-first functionality and real-time sync with Firestore.

## Features

- **Add, edit, and delete todos** with title, description, priority, and due date.
- **Offline-first:** Works seamlessly without internet; syncs with Firestore when online.
- **Automatic and manual sync:** Syncs data automatically on network changes, or manually via the sync button.
- **Duplicate prevention:** Smart logic to avoid duplicate todos during sync.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **State management:** Uses Bloc for predictable state handling.
- **Persistent storage:** Local SQLite database for offline access.
- **Firebase integration:** Uses Firestore for cloud sync and Firebase Core for initialization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with Firestore enabled

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd todo_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase setup:**
   - Add your `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to the respective directories.
   - Update `firebase_options.dart` if needed (generated by FlutterFire CLI).

4. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-specific notes

- **Web:** Supported, but ensure Firestore rules allow web access.
- **Desktop:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (see Flutter docs for setup).

## Key Packages

- `flutter_bloc` – State management
- `cloud_firestore` – Firestore integration
- `firebase_core` – Firebase initialization
- `logger` – Logging
- `get_it` – Dependency injection
- `intl` – Date formatting

## Sync & Duplicate Handling

- The app uses a local database for all operations.
- When online, it syncs with Firestore, merging changes and preventing duplicates using `firestore_id` and content-based matching.
- Manual sync can be triggered via the sync button in the UI.
